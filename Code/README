Nothing special to know.

Please modify/run script "distributed_network.m". The parameters are pretty straightforward.

You may want to read dn_simulate and dn_generate_nodes, all parameters are specified in the header.

The files runset* are meant to be run using the Python's fabric script (see in ../fabric) and analyzeset* should be use to reproduce the graphs.

Every other files are functions. They are documented in the header.
